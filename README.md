# Song Safari
A website to help discover new music genres based on your Spotify playlist.

## Please Note:
My Spotify API is still on developer mode. The normal login method will not work. If you'd like to be added to my allowlist, please contact me with your email and name used for your Spotify account. I will add them to my allowlist as soon as I see them.

The guest version will still require you to log in with your Spotify account or create a new one. However, the playlists and songs you see will be sourced from my account.

## Introduction
The Problem: Discovering new and diverse music genres can be challenging for users. Many listeners find themselves stuck in familiar genres and are unaware of the vast array of music available.

The Goal: Help users build more varied and interesting music libraries and enjoy a richer auditory experience. Song Safari leverages users' Spotify playlists to help them discover new music genres. By analyzing the genres of songs in their playlists, the website can recommend related but unfamiliar genres.
